The California primary is on Super Tuesday, coming up fast...

# Fed
* President: write in Hind Rajab, the little girl murdered by zionist tanks in gaza
* Senate: Lee - she might be a spoiler vote that enables a republican to get on the ballot, but she's better on Gaza, and it's hard to care about anything else rn
* Rep: Simon is the least bad. I wanted to like Tran until I actually [listened to her talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzU5pyjCUgw)

# State
* Senate: beckles. it's tempting to have kalb fail up, but bleh
* Ass 14: Smith
* Ass 18: Bonta will definitely win 1st place. Sandford is sus, but I'd much rather see him on the ballot than a Republican. So I will vote Sandford. Top-two is wild.
* Prop 1: NO don't fall for this carceral crap

# County
* Supe 4: Esteen
* Supe 5: Bas
* Judge 5: idk
* Judge 12: idk
* Measure A: idk
* Measure B: idk

# City
* Auditor: idk
* Measure D: idk
