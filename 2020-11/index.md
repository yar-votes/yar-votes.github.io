tagline: Oakland, California, November 2020

* Ballots are out, early & mail-in voting has begun
* Last day to request a mail ballot: Tuesday, October 27
* Ballots must be postmarked by election day: Tuesday, November 3
* Ballots must be received by Friday, November 6

# US
* **President: Joe Fuckface Biden** He fucking sucks. Fuck this fucking piece of shit. Please vote for him and then if he wins, immediately start throwing things at him. He's awful. But **VOTE FOR HIM NONETHELESS!!!**
* **House: Nobody** Barbara Lee is too comfortable, getting outflanked on the left by newer reps.

# California
* **Prop 14: NO** Don't subsidize big pharma unless you also tax it back
* **Prop 15: YES** Large commercial properties should pay taxes. Long-overdue reform.
* **Prop 16: YES** Legalize affirmative action
* **Prop 17: YES** Let ex-cons vote
* **Prop 18: YES** Let 17yos vote in primaries
* **Prop 19: idk** Flawed but might help somebody
* **Prop 20: NO** We need fewer people in prison, not more. Fuck this measure.
* **Prop 21: YES** Legalize rent control
* **Prop 22: NO** Uber, Lyft & Doordash just want to keep exploiting their workers
* **Prop 23: NO** I'm loathe to side with bosses over unions, but must accept that in this case, the prop is a bullshit sideshow which would be bad for patients. [source](https://www.rsnhope.org/rsn-blog/no-pro-23/) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/health/kidney-dialysis-kickbacks.html) [3](https://www.cmadocs.org/newsroom/news/view/ArticleId/38532/CMA-Board-of-Trustees-votes-to-oppose-dialysis-ballot-initiative)
* **Prop 24: NO** Pretends to be pro-privacy, but waters down privacy laws.
* **Prop 25: YES** Tough call. Doesn't go far enough to check racist judges, but ending cash bail will make future reform easier by cutting out the loan shark industry. After much thought I lean towards shaking up the status quo on this.
* **Senate District 7: Nobody** Glazer sucks & the republican won't win
* **Senate District 9: Nobody** Fuck Skinner and her right-libertarian challenger too
* **Assembly District 15: Brink** Wicks takes dirty money
* **Assembly District 18: Bonta** He's not perfect, probably doesn't need your help, but I'm feeling cautious about the Republican

# Alameda County
* **Measure V: YES** Open to changing my mind, since unincorporated areas tend to be poorer
* **Measure W: YES** Iffy about sales tax, but homeless services ++
* **Measure X: YES** I support fire department upgrades because I enjoy breathing air
* **Transit At-Large: Victoria Fierce** I'll always side-eye her housing politics & history with SFBARF/YIMBY but this might be a good fit for her. Dollene Jones would be my first choice if she championed free rides the way Fierce does.
* **Transit Ward 2: Jean Walsh** Harper is smart but annoying, he isn't even trying anymore. Meanwhile, Walsh's history with Lyft concerns me, but I'm feeling generous towards her as a wide-eyed newcomer who hates cars.

# East Bay / Regional
* **Superior Court Judge Office #2: Elena Condes**
* **Peralta Board Area 2: \*shrug\*** [Jenkins](https://www.jenkinsforperalta.com/) unopposed, libs like him
* **Peralta Board Area 6: \*shrug\*** [Polk](https://www.dyanaforperalta.com/) unopposed
* **BART District 3: whatever** Saltzman unopposed, liberals seem to like her
* **BART District 7: Lateefah Simon** BART Police are so afraid of this blind black incumbent, they send her death threats and are running their own candidate (Kidd) to represent cops
* **EBRP Ward 2: \*shrug\*** Rosario unopposed
* **EBRP Ward 4: \*shrug\*** Corbett unopposed

# Oakland
* These are rank choice, so I'm recommending a full slate each
* **Council District 1: Ngo, Kalb, Nobody** I've always had a soft spot for Kalb, but gotta give the longshot some love first. [Walton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6Dp0ZjsRU) is a naive well-connected semi-reformist neoliberal, I'm not impressed.
* **Council District 3: Fife, Taylor, Semedar** Fife will represent the grassroots in West Oakland like few have before. McElhaney is a disaster
* **Council District 5: Lopez-Meraz, Raya, Nobody** Two [awesome progressive challengers](https://twitter.com/zoelopezmeraz/status/1302338841639034886). Enough of Gallo already
* **Council District 7: Clay, Tatmon, Nobody** Reid would be an establishment party hack
* **Council At Large: Kaplan, Nobody, Nobody** The others are all corporate shills
* **School District 1: Thomas, Davis, Nobody** All these school races are perennially about stopping charters, land sell-offs, and prison pipelines.
* **School District 3: Gash, Williams, Santana**
* **School District 5: Hutchinson, Lerma, Pope-Lawrence**
* **School District 7: Molina, Tapscott, Valerio**
* **City Attorney: idk** Parker is too soft on cops, but I don't trust Ferran, and neither do his former coworkers, as they all donated money to their current boss's campaign. It's a mess, I'm inclined to stay out of it.
* **Measure QQ: YES** Let 16yos vote for school board
* **Measure RR: NO** regressive fines
* **Measure S1: YES** More cop oversight
* **Measure Y: YES** Schools need the money. Mostly taxes the rich & benefits the poor.
