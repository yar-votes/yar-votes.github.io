* Last day to request a mail ballot: Tuesday, October 27
* Ballots must be postmarked by election day: Tuesday, November 3
* Ballots must be received by Friday, November 6

US
* **President: Joe Fuckface Biden** He fucking sucks. Fuck this fucking piece of shit. Please vote for him and then if he wins, immediately start throwing things at him. He's awful. But **VOTE FOR HIM NONETHELESS!!!**
* **House: Write in Assata Shakur** or whoever else you like. Barbara Lee is too comfortable, getting outflanked on the left by newer reps.

California
* **Prop 14: NO** Stem cells are cool but don't subsidize private companies
* **Prop 15: YES** Large commercial properties should pay taxes
* **Prop 16: YES** Affirmative action should not be illegal
* **Prop 17: YES** Let ex-cons vote
* **Prop 18: YES** Let 17yos vote in primaries
* **Prop 19: idk** Flawed but might help somebody
* **Prop 20: NO** We need fewer people in prison, not more. Fuck this measure.
* **Prop 21: YES** Rent control should not be illegal
* **Prop 22: NO** Uber, Lyft & Doordash just want to keep exploiting their workers
* **Prop 23: YES** Support dialysis patients & workers against [their corrupt bosses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/health/kidney-dialysis-kickbacks.html)
* **Prop 24: NO** Pretends to be pro-privacy, but it waters down privacy laws.
* **Prop 25: YES** Tough call. Doesn't go far enough to check racist judges, but ending cash bail will make future reform easier by cutting out the loan shark industry. After much thought I lean towards shaking up the status quo on this.
* **Senate District 5: Eggman** Social worker & environmentalist
* **Senate District 9: Nobody** Fuck Skinner and her right-libertarian challenger too
* **Senate District 11: Fielder** Helped pass the [Public Banking Act](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/california-governor-public-banking-law-ab857)
* **Senate District 17: Laird**
* **Assembly District 15: Brink** A protest vote, but fuck Wicks
* **Assembly District 18: Bonta** He's not perfect, probably doesn't need your help, but I'm feeling cautious about the Republican challenger
* **Assembly District 25: Lee**

# Alameda County
* **Supervisor District 1: Bacon**
* **Measure V: YES** Open to changing my mind though, since unincorporated areas tend to be poorer
* **Measure W: YES** Again, feel iffy about sales tax
* **Measure X: YES** I support fire department upgrades because I enjoy breathing air
* **Transit At-Large: Victoria Fierce** I'll always side-eye her housing politics & history with SFBARF/YIMBY but this would probably be a good fit for her. Keep an eye on this woman.
* **Transit Ward 1: Jovanka Beckles** I endorsed her for state assembly last time. Would still love to see her get a foothold.
* **Transit Ward 2: Jean Walsh** Harper's OK, but gotta support a newcomer who hates cars

# East Bay / Regional
* **Superior Court Judge Office #2: Elena Condes**
* **Peralta Board Area 1: Jeff Heyman**
* **Peralta Board Area 2: idk** Wellstone likes [Kevin Jenkins](https://www.jenkinsforperalta.com/)

* **BART District 4: idk yet**
* **BART District 5: John McPartland**
* **BART District 7: Lateefah Simon** BART police are afraid of her, nuff said
* **EBRP Ward 1: Norman LaForce**
* **EBRP Ward 2: idk** Wellstone like the incumbent, Dee Rosario
* **EBRP Ward 3: idk**
* **EBRP Ward 4: idk**

# Oakland
* These are ranked choice, so I'm recommending a full slate of candidates for each district.
* **Council District 1: Ngo, Kalb, Nobody** I've always had a soft spot for Kalb, but gotta give the longshot some love first. [Walton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6Dp0ZjsRU) is a naive semi-reformist neoliberal, I'm not impressed.
* **Council District 3: Fife, Scott, Semedar** Fife will represent the grassroots in West Oakland like few have before.
* **Council District 5: Raya, Lopez-Meraz, Nobody** Enough of Gallo already
* **Council District 7: Clay, Tatmon, Nobody**
* **Council At Large: Kaplan, Nobody, Nobody** The others are all corporate shills
* **School District 1: Thomas, Davis, Nobody** All these school races are perennially about stopping charters, land sell-offs, and prison pipelines.
* **School District 3: Gash, Williams, Nobody**
* **School District 5: Hutchinson, Nobody, Nobody**
* **School District 7: Tapscott, Valerio, Molina**
* **City Attorney: Ferran** Incumbent is too soft on cops
* **Measure QQ: YES** Let 16yos vote for school board
* **Measure RR: NO** regressive fines
* **Measure S1: YES** More cop oversight
* **Measure Y: YES** Schools need the money

# elsewhere

* **Sonoma County Measure P: YES** Actual cop oversight with teeth. Significant experimental reform that could be a model for the whole country.
