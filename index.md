# intro

I'm open to changing my mind on any of these! Try to convince me!

# Federal

* **Senate: Kevin De Leon** Only the top two vote-getters in this primary will be on the November ballot. #1 will certainly be Feinstein, and the rest are scrambling for #2. Republicans are doing frighteningly well, including an [actual nazi](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/patrick-little-neo-nazi-california/) who [polled in 2nd place](http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e60651f4-03ad-4a80-9b0d-09bc68bbdc74) last month. Some leftists love Hildebrand, but he's not viable. Because De Leon takes corporate money and endorsed Clinton two years ago, the Green Party wants you to WRITE IN some rando with no campaign - this makes me so angry! Even the [SF Berniecrats](http://www.sfberniecrats.com/june_2018_endorsements) have gotten over it and picked De Leon. If you want to actually replace Feinstein with someone better, and you don't want to spend this whole year dealing with california nazis, please please please hold your nose and vote for De Leon!

# California

* **Governor: Delaine Eastin**
* **Lt Gov: Gayle McLaughlin**
* **Sec of State: Alex Padilla** Tough call. I like Rydberg but Padilla is the safer bet. Republicans are polling well, this race is too close to spoil.
* **Controller: Betty Yee** Again, Finley is better but Yee is safer.
* **Treasurer: Kevin Akin**
* **Atty General: Dave Jones** I wanted to like Becerra but he's wishywashy on the death penalty
* **Insurance Commissioner: Nathalie Hrizi** Poizner sucks and Lara is safest bet, but Hrizi is worth the risk here IMO. If you're feeling super nervous vote Lara I guess.
* ** Board of Equalizations 2: none** No great candidates, position has no power
* ** Superintendent of Public Instruction: Tony Thurmond** Tuck is a charter school shill.

# East Bay / Alameda County / Oakland

* **US Assembly District 13: write in Laura Wells** I don't usually like write-ins. Barbara Lee is running unopposed, she is honestly a great rep compared to most of Congress, and she is going to win. This is a good, safe chance to pressure her from the left and keep her more accountable.
* **State Assembly District 18: Rob Bonta** he's not great but Slauson sucks
* **Supervisor 3rd District: Wilma Chan** She voted against Urban Shield. Even though she's running unopposed, she deserves a boost for that.
* **Assessor: Phong La**
* **Clerk: Melissa Wilk**
* **DA: Pamela Price** An actual factual prison abolitionist, endorsed by Angela Davis. For real.
* **Sheriff: write in anyone** Seriously, Ahern is monster and he's running unopposed. Write in anyone else and remember to fill in the arrow. Write in your mom, or "fuck you". Either works.

# the great gay judge debate

this deserves its own section...
