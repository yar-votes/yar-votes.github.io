# intro

Remember to vote on November 6! Stay tuned here for more info.

# US

* **Senate: Kevin De Leon** Still a tool, but better than Feinstein
* **Assembly District 13: Laura Wells** Barbara Lee is running unopposed, she is honestly a great rep compared to most of Congress, and she is going to win. This is a good, safe chance to pressure her from the left and keep her more accountable.

# California

* **Governor: Gavin Newsom** Lesser of two evils

# East Bay / Alameda County / Oakland

* **Oakland Mayor: 1) Cat Brooks 2) Pamela Price 3) Saied Karamooz** Ranked choice
* **Oakland District 2: 1) Nikki Bas** Guillen is an ally of Libby Schaaf and is fucking over sex workers
* **Oakland District 4: 1) Nayeli Maxson 2) Pamela Harris 3) Sheng Thao**
* **Oakland District 6: nobody?** Brooks v Whittaker
