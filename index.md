title: Yar's Voting Guide
---

This is a voting guide for me and my friends & neighbors. We have no upcoming elections in 2019 - the next thing to worry about is the California primaries in March 2020.

* First debate: Wednesday June 26, 2019 (soon!)
* Voter registration deadline: Monday, February 17, 2020
* Election day: Tuesday, March 3, 2020
* Send me comments and feedback as a [pull request](https://github.com/yar-votes/yar-votes.github.io/pulls), [github issue](https://github.com/yar-votes/yar-votes.github.io/issues), or email me at [yardenack@gmail.com](mailto:yardenack@gmail.com)

# US President

Since the first debate is in a few weeks, it's getting very unlikely we'll see any more new candidates. I'll almost certainly be voting for one of these people, but I don't know who yet:
* [Democratic candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Candidates)
* [Green party candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Green_Party_presidential_primaries#Candidates)
