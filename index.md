Our next election is the [California Primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_Democratic_primary) on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020. I will probably vote for **Liz Warren**.

None of the [Green Party candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Green_Party_presidential_primaries#Candidates) has enough experience. I have supported Greens for president in the past, and I'm even sympathetic to their need to maintain numbers (which help them access coverage, debates, ballot status and federal funding) but I cannot endorse any of them this round, given the urgency of defeating Trump, and because I strongly believe that the Green Party should focus more resources on supporting state & local candidates who could eventually have enough experience to run for President.

Here's a rough calendar:
