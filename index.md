Our next election is the California Primary on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020. I am registered No Party Preference and will request a Democratic ballot at the poll. How will I vote?

US
* **President: Liz Warren** Bernie is a bit to her left on some things but not enough and not on race. She'll also get more good things done.
* **Rep: write in Angela Davis** Barbara Lee will win. Nobody's running against her on the left. Good chance to protest by writing in our local prison abolitionist scholar, or someone else who you admire

California
* **Senator: write in Hothead Paisan** Nancy Skinner isn't fighting hard enough for the left vote - let her know.
* **Assembly Dist 15: Sara Brink** Purely a protest vote. Don't worry, the republican won't win.
* **Office 2 Judge: Elena Condes** Progressive queer latina former defense attorney endorsed by incumbent. Definite yes.
* **Prop 13: no** School bonds are ok but this waives developer fees and subsidizes charter schools. Not to be confused with [that other thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13)

Alameda County
* **Dist 5 Supervisor: none** I don't know
* **Measure C: yes** sales tax is super regressive, but it's only a half cent and childcare is good

Oakland
* **Measure Q: YES** parcel tax of $150/year is also a bit regressive, but worth it for homeless services
* **Measure R: YES** completely necessary and boring technicality. lets city council decide what newspaper you have to publish notices in, since the last one closed. lol journalism is dying this is fine
* **Measure S: YES** the obligatory "are you sure you want your city to continue operating?" because [Paul Gann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gann) hates us

Elsewhere
* If you're in [CA's 63rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_63rd_State_Assembly_district) (LA) please help vote out [Anthony Rendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rendon_(politician)), who blocked a debate on universal health care!
