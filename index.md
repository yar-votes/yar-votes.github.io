# intro

I'm open to changing my mind on any of these! Try to convince me!

 *Remember to vote on June 5!!!*

# US

* **Senate: Kevin De Leon** Only the top two vote-getters in this primary will be on the November ballot. #1 will certainly be Feinstein, and the rest are scrambling for #2. Republicans are doing frighteningly well, including an [actual nazi](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/patrick-little-neo-nazi-california/) who [polled in 2nd place](http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=e60651f4-03ad-4a80-9b0d-09bc68bbdc74) last month. Some leftists love Hildebrand, but he's not viable. Because De Leon takes corporate money and endorsed Clinton two years ago, the Green Party wants you to [WRITE IN](https://acgreens.wordpress.com/voter-guides/) some rando with no campaign - this makes me so angry! Even the [SF Berniecrats](http://www.sfberniecrats.com/june_2018_endorsements) have gotten over it and picked De Leon. If you want to actually replace Feinstein with someone better, and you don't want to spend all summer dealing with california nazis, please please please hold your nose and vote for De Leon!
* **Assembly District 13: write in Laura Wells** I don't usually like write-ins. Barbara Lee is running unopposed, she is honestly a great rep compared to most of Congress, and she is going to win. This is a good, safe chance to pressure her from the left and keep her more accountable.

# California

* **Governor: Delaine Eastin** Newsom loves gays as long as you're not homeless. Villaraigosa is part of the corporate party machine. There's no right-wing mega-evils in this race, only Democrat kilo-evils. Eastin is a great, safe vote for leftists and liberals alike.
* **Lt Gov: Gayle McLaughlin**
* **Sec of State: Alex Padilla** Tough call. I like Rydberg but Padilla is the safer bet. Republicans are polling well, this race is too close to spoil.
* **Controller: Betty Yee** Again, Finley is better but Yee is safer.
* **Treasurer: Kevin Akin**
* **Atty General: Dave Jones** I wanted to like Becerra but he's wishywashy on the death penalty
* **Insurance Commissioner: Nathalie Hrizi** Poizner sucks and Lara is safest bet, but Hrizi is worth the risk here IMO. If you're feeling super nervous vote Lara I guess.
* **Board of Equalizations 2: none** No great candidates, position has no power
* **Supe of Public Instruction: Tony Thurmond** Tuck is a charter school shill.

# East Bay / Alameda County / Oakland

* **State Assembly District 18: Rob Bonta** he's not great but Slauson sucks
* **Supervisor 3rd District: Wilma Chan** She voted against Urban Shield. Even though she's running unopposed, she deserves a boost for that. There's also a write-in candidate, Leslie Bonett, if you're feeling oppositional.
* **Assessor: Phong La**
* **Clerk: Melissa Wilk**
* **DA: Pamela Price** An actual factual prison abolitionist, endorsed by Angela Davis. For real. I am so happy I get to vote for her.
* **Sheriff: write in anyone** Seriously, Ahern is monster and he's running unopposed. Write in anyone else and remember to fill in the arrow. Write in your mom, or "fuck you". Either works.

# the great gay judge debate

**Superior Court Judge #11: Karen Katz** ho boy. this deserves its own section...

Alameda County Superior Court has [dozens of judges](https://ballotpedia.org/Superior_Court_of_Alameda_County,_California). When they come up for renewal every few years, they usually stay off the ballot, unless someone decides to pick *that judge in particular* and run a campaign against them.

[Judge Kolakowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Kolakowski) is a transgender woman, and [Judge Flanagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Flanagan) is a cis lesbian. All the other judges are straight and cis.

Flanagan has [a reputation](http://www.therobingroom.com/california/Judge.aspx?id=14941) for being man-hating and racist. I am sure that the man-hating part is based in part on hateful stereotypes about lesbians. And I am sure that the racism part is real. She is a "former-prosecutor-turned-domestic-violence-survivor's advocate" which screams carceral feminism.

A defense attorney, Karen Katz, who is also a bisexual woman, is [challenging Flanagan](https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/karen-katz-says-her-challenge-of-judge-tara-flanagan-should-surprise-no-one/Content?oid=16110763). Katz has a history of personal grudges against Flanagan and has even faced her in court, but she says her campaign is focused on bail reform and restorative justice. Meanwhile Flanagan and her supporters are calling Katz's campaign [homophobic](https://eastbaystonewalldemocrats.org/news/5883000), which sounds a lot like bi erasure.

I think Katz should have run against a different judge. I'm sure Flanagan is terrible, and I'm sure there are even worse judges out there. The decision to run a dirty campaign distracts from any systemic issues she claims to care about. At worst it inspires conspiracy theories from cis lesbians. At best it's a poor, shortsighted, almost tragic way to start a career.

I'll vote for Katz, but the whole thing is a mess IMO.
