# intro

* Early voting has [already started](https://www.acvote.org/erl)!
* Voter registration deadline: Monday, October 22
* Election day: Tuesday, November 6
* Send me comments and feedback as a [pull request](https://github.com/yar-votes/yar-votes.github.io/pulls), [github issue](https://github.com/yar-votes/yar-votes.github.io/issues), or email me at [yardenack@gmail.com](mailto:yardenack@gmail.com)

# US

* **Senate: Kevin De Leon** Still a tool, but better than Feinstein
* **House Rep CA-13: Laura Wells** Barbara Lee is honestly a great rep compared to most of Congress, and she is going to win. This is a good, safe chance to pressure her from the left and keep her more accountable.

# California

* **State Assembly**
  * **District 15: Jovanka Beckles** She was ableist towards Vinay Pimple, and that sucks. But that doesn't make Buffy Wicks any better.
  * **District 18: Rob Bonta** Not great but Slauson sucks
* **State Supreme Court**
  * **Carol Corrigan: no recommendation** A lesbian who wrote a dissent against gay marriage which still passed in a 7-2 decision. Is she actually that self-hating, or did she just provide cover and legitimacy to the court by writing that toothless dissent which didn't effect the outcome, and which in the long run provides a good counter-example to those people who want to claim gay judges have a [conflict of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughn_Walker)? I can't even with this shit, and I'm throwing my hands up. Vote however you want.
  * **Leondra Kruger: YES**
  * **James Humes: YES**
  * **Sandra Margulies: NO**
  * **James Richman: NO**
  * **Marla Miller: NO**
  * **Peter John Siggins: YES**
  * **Alison Tucher: YES**
  * **Jon Streeter: YES**
  * **Barbara Jones: YES**
* **State Executives**
  * **Governor: Gavin Newsom** Lesser of two evils
  * **Lt Gov: Ed Hernandez** Most progressives seem to be for Kounalakis, but I'm actually not sure why
  * **Sec of State: Alex Padilla**
  * **Controller: Betty Yee**
  * **Treasurer: Fiona Ma** Even though she supported [Josephine](http://www.sfexaminer.com/school-board-candidate-fire-past-transphobic-statements/) [Zhao](https://missionlocal.org/2018/09/josephine-zhao-mayor-breed-scott-wiener-circle-the-wagons-for-embattled-candidate-but-for-how-long/)
  * **Atty Gen: Xavier Becerra**
  * **Insurance Commissioner: Ricardo Lara**
  * **Board of Eq 2: Malia Cohen**
  * **Supe of Public Instruction: Tony Thurmond** Tuck is a charter school shill.
* **Prop 1: YES** housing for veterans
* **Prop 2: NO** This is a tough one, but I'll honor [NAMI Contra Costa](http://www.namicontracosta.org/)'s call to vote no, based on [their reasoning](http://www.namicontracosta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/September_2018.pdf): voters approved the [MHSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Mental_Health_Services_Act) as [Prop 63 on the 2004 ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_63_(2004)) to fund direct services for "seriously mentally ill" people, which enables places like NAMICC to exist. Our state reps tried to redirect that money towards developers using the [Housing First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_First) ideology as cover. They got sued and lost their court case, because this wasn't the original intent of MHSA! So now they're trying to trick voters into undoing our 2004 vote with this new Proposition. It doesn't create *new* funding for disabled people, it only repurposes *existing* money, and quite wastefully too: $6 billion to house 20,000 people would be better spent just handing them $300,000 each. But of course most of that money will go to contractors and bondholders, which is the real motivation here.
* **Prop 3: NO** corporate handout, may lead to more dams
* **Prop 4: NO** $$ for childrens hospitals sounds good, but many of these are for-profit and should not be subsidized. come back with a proposal limited to public (university) hospitals or give the money directly to kids and their families who need it
* **Prop 5: NO** cutting school funds to bribe overhoused people into moving, is not a real solution to the housing crisis
* **Prop 6: NO** Don't let them repeal the gas tax. It should be more progressive, but meanwhile it funds public transit
* **Prop 7: YES** Daylight Savings year round
* **Prop 8: YES** Cheaper dialysis - ignore the fancy corporate fliers telling you this will kill people.
* **Prop 10: YES** rent control is good
* **Prop 11: NO** ambulance drivers deserve to take breaks
* **Prop 12: YES** Safer, less cruel meat & eggs

# Alameda County / East Bay

* **Assessor: Phong La**
* **AC Transit Director: Dollene Jones**
* **BART District 4: Robert Raburn**
* **Peralta Trustees**
  * **Area 3: Corean Todd**
  * **Area 5: Cindi Reiss**
* **Measure E: YES** $$ for colleges
* **Measure G: YES** $$ for colleges
* **Measure FF: NO** Money for parks is good, but they wants to cut down a bunch of trees and spray herbicide, which [concerns](https://defendeastbayforests.wordpress.com/measureff/) [many](https://milliontrees.me/2018/09/08/wildfire-cover-story-is-the-lie-that-binds/) [people](https://www.facebook.com/savetheeastbayhills/) ... they don't need this money until 2021, so let's force them to come back with a better proposal next year

# Oakland

These races are ranked choice, so if your #1 choice doesn't win, your vote goes to the #2 choice and so on. Beware that putting someone as your #3 is *STILL VOTING FOR THEM*! If you don't like someone, it's better to have no #3 than to rank them in.

* **Mayor: 1) Cat Brooks 2) Pamela Price 3) Saied Karamooz** 
* **Auditor:  Courtney Ruby**
* **City Council**
  * **District 2: 1) Kenzie Smith 2) Nikki Bas 3) nobody** Kenzie Smith was famously harassed by "BBQ Becky" and deserves our support. Guillen is an ally of Libby Schaaf and is [fucking over sex workers](https://uspros.net/2018/09/11/stop-legislation-in-oakland-that-targets-sex-workers-clients/), so do *not* add him as #3
  * **District 4: 1) Sheng Thao 2) Nayeli Maxson 3) Pamela Harris**
  * **District 6: 1) Mya Whitaker 2) Marlo Rodriguez 3) Desley Brooks** I have deep reservations about Brooks, but she's better than Schaaf-aligned challengers Taylor & Middleton, so she gets a #3 rank
* **Measure V: YES** less taxes for pot stores
* **Measure W: YES** tax vacant land
* **Measure X: YES** tax luxury housing
* **Measure Y: YES** make it harder to evict renters in a duplex
* **Measure Z: YES** protect hotel workers
* **Measure AA: NO** regressive housing tax, supposed to fund schools but no accountability and undermines existing programs
