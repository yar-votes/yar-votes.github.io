# **DON'T RECALL NEWSOM!!!!**

The governor recall election ends on September 14. Please vote **NO** - do not recall governor Newsom. Yes, he's bad. Yes, there may be some candidates better than him. But you will not get them. The question isn't "do you like him", it's "do you want our next governor to be elected by a simple plurality of the smaller subset of voters who dislike him enough to recall him." Think it through. It's a rigged con job. You will lose. Republicans will win. Don't fall for it. Vote **NO**!

In addition to voting NO, on the second question I will be voting for **Dan Kapelovitz** to replace Newsom in case the recall goes through. It's important to vote NO while also voting for a non-terrible candidate. We want to prevent a recall, but we also want to lower the pluralities of dangerous right-wingers.

## August 31 special election

If you live inside this black border, you have a special election on August 31 to replace Rob Bonta (now [attygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California)) as your state assemblymember. My favorite candidate is **Janani Ramachandran**.
