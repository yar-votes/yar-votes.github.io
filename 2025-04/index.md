as usual, my suggestions are deeply compromised but without them, worse things will happen. i don't like it, but a vote is not a valentine, etc etc. we are just not organized enough yet to get real change through any electoral process. but those of us with the privilege to choose our preferred opponent should still use it.

* **Oakland Mayor: Barbara Lee**
* **Measure A: YES**
* **Council 2: 1) Murray-Badal 2) Lowe 3) Anderson**
