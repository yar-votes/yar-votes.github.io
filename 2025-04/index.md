We'll be voting for a new mayor since Sheng Thao was recalled. Some initial thoughts on the candidates:
* **Barbara Lee**: i'm ambivalent. don't trust her intentions. i think she cares more about her career than about oakland, and is only running because she gambled her congress seat for a senate run and lost. she was the best candidate in the senate race, and it's awful she lost, but we should have higher standards for oakland.
* **Loren Taylor**: too cozy with cops & landlords, no thanks
* ABSOLUTELY DO NOT VOTE FOR: Liu, Pechenuk

Oakland City Council district 2 will vote to replace Nikki Bas

Oakland will also vote on a sales tax increase from 10.25% to 10.75%
