Initial thoughts on mayor candidates:
* **Barbara Lee**: i'm ambivalent. don't trust her intentions. i think she cares more about her career than about oakland, and is only running because she gambled her congress seat for a senate run and lost. she was the best candidate in the senate race, and it's awful she lost, but we should have higher standards for oakland. on the other hand, if she can use her significant political capital to keep the cops in check during a time of heightened danger for our communities, then she might be the best candidate we have.
* **Loren Taylor**: too cozy with cops & landlords, meh
* NEED MORE INFO ON: Adams Gatlin Grappo Jeffries Jordan Simpson Smith Webb Young
* DON'T VOTE FOR: Liu Pechenuk Swaney

City council district 2 will vote to replace Nikki Bas

Oakland will also vote on a sales tax increase from 10.25% to 10.75%
