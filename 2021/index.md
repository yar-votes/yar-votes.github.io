## June 29 primary

If you live inside this black border, you have a special election primary on June 29 to replace Rob Bonta (now [attygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California)) as your state assemblymember. My favorite candidate is **Janani Ramachandran** in the **Democratic Primary**.

## August 31 special election

If nobody gets a majority in the June 29 primary, there will be a general election.

## governor

We'll probably be voting soon on whether to recall & replace governor Newsom but nobody knows if/when yet.
