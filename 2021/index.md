## August 31 special election

If you live inside this black border, you have a special election on August 31 to replace Rob Bonta (now [attygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California)) as your state assemblymember. My favorite candidate is **Janani Ramachandran**.

## governor

We'll probably be voting soon on whether to recall & replace governor Newsom but nobody knows if/when yet.
