# SIMPLE VOTING GUIDE WEBSITE

Nothing more, nothing less. My content is geared towards voters in Oakland, California, but you can fork it for wherever.

Website is at: https://yar-votes.github.io/

Theme based on a very old version of [leapday](https://github.com/mattgraham/leapday) that I should really update.
